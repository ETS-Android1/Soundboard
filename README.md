# Android Soundboard App

This is a simple Android app that plays a selection of pre-loaded sounds. It was made with the specific intent of mocking opponents while playing card games and board games. 
The application was developed with assistance from CodeRed at [CodeRed Development](youtube.com/channel/UC2fXwNJZGkEsN_7Q2tg-n-A) on YouTube.
